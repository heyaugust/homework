What is currying?
Currying allows partial implementation of a function. If we pass all the arguments the function will run, we can also pass part of the arguments in the curried function. 

When to use currying?
If a high level function has multiple arguments, we can use currying to breakdown the high level function and do partial implementations. This way we can reuse a simple function to call the high level function. Code more readable.
